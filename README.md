## Why?

- Easily import real live site styles for a starting point for designs and prototypes
- Quickly turn real site components into design components
- Easy import from storybook, etc

## Limitations

Importing HTML layers to Figma is a best-effort process. Even getting 90% there can save you a ton of time, only having to clean up a few things.

A few known limitations:

- not all element types are supported (e.g. iframe, pseudoelements)
- not all CSS properties are supported or fully supported
- not all types of media are supported (video, animated gifs, etc)
- all fonts have to be uploaded to Figma or a best effort fallback will be used

If you find any issues or have feedback at all please [make an issue](https://github.com/BuilderIO/html-to-figma/issues/new)

## Todo
